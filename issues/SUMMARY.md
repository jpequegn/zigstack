- **#36**: Enhance CI/CD pipeline
- **#37**: Release preparation for v0.3.0

**Phase 4 Duration**: 30-38 hours

## Total Project Scope

- **Total Issues**: 21 GitHub issues
- **Total Estimated Effort**: 127-165 hours (3-4 weeks full-time)
- **New Commands**: 6 (organize, analyze, dedupe, archive, watch, workspace)
- **Breaking Changes**: None (100% backward compatible)

## Quick Reference: New Commands

### 1. `zigstack organize` (Default)
Current functionality, now as explicit command. Can still be called implicitly.
```bash
zigstack organize --move /path
zigstack --move /path  # Still works
```

### 2. `zigstack analyze`
Disk usage analysis with optional content inspection.
```bash
zigstack analyze /path
zigstack analyze --content --format json /path
```

### 3. `zigstack dedupe`
Interactive duplicate file management with hardlink support.
```bash
zigstack dedupe /path
zigstack dedupe --hardlink --auto keep-oldest /path
```

### 4. `zigstack archive`
Age-based file archiving with compression.
```bash
zigstack archive --older-than 6mo --compress tar.gz /path
```

### 5. `zigstack watch`
File system monitoring daemon with rule-based automation.
```bash
zigstack watch --rules watch-rules.json ~/Downloads
```

### 6. `zigstack workspace`
Developer workspace management and cleanup.
```bash
zigstack workspace scan ~/Code
zigstack workspace cleanup --strategy conservative ~/Code
```

## Implementation Priority

### Critical Path
1. Complete Phase 1 (foundation) first - all other work depends on it
2. Phase 2 can proceed in parallel tracks once Phase 1 is done
3. Phase 3 builds on Phase 2 but commands are independent
4. Phase 4 is final integration and release

### Recommended Order
1. **Week 1**: Phase 1 - Refactoring and foundation
2. **Week 2**: Phase 2 - Core commands (organize, analyze, dedupe)
3. **Week 3**: Phase 3 - Advanced commands (archive, watch, workspace)
4. **Week 4**: Phase 4 - Polish, documentation, release

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture
```
src/
├── main.zig              # Entry point, command routing
├── core/                 # Shared functionality
│   ├── file_info.zig
│   ├── organization.zig
│   ├── config.zig
│   ├── tracker.zig
│   ├── utils.zig
│   └── export.zig
└── commands/             # Command implementations
    ├── command.zig       # Command interface
    ├── organize.zig
    ├── analyze.zig
    ├── dedupe.zig
    ├── archive.zig
    ├── watch.zig
    └── workspace.zig
```

### 2. Backward Compatibility
- All existing v0.2.0 CLI patterns continue to work
- Direct path argument implies `organize` command
- All current flags preserved
- No breaking changes

### 3. Shared Infrastructure
- Common options (--verbose, --dry-run) work across commands
- Consistent output formatting and error handling
- Unified export functionality (JSON/CSV)
- Shared file analysis and categorization logic

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each module
- Integration tests for command interactions
- Backward compatibility regression tests
- Performance benchmarks in CI
