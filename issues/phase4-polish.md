# Phase 4: Polish & Release - GitHub Issues

## Issue #27: Performance Optimization

**Title**: Optimize performance across all commands

**Description**:
Profile and optimize performance to ensure all commands meet performance targets.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Profile each command for bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize file I/O operations
- [ ] Implement parallel processing where applicable
- [ ] Optimize memory allocations and reduce copies
- [ ] Add performance tests to CI
- [ ] Document performance characteristics
- [ ] Compare against baseline (v0.2.0)

**Performance Targets**:
- **organize**: >1000 files/sec (current baseline)
- **analyze**: >1000 files/sec for disk usage, >500 files/sec with --content
- **dedupe**: >500 files/sec for hashing
- **archive**: Limited by I/O, but minimize overhead
- **watch**: <50ms response time for file events
- **workspace**: >100 projects/sec for scanning

**Optimization Areas**:
1. **File I/O**: Use buffered I/O, batch operations
2. **Hashing**: Parallel hash calculation for duplicates
3. **Memory**: Reduce allocations, reuse buffers
4. **Algorithms**: Optimize sorting and data structures
5. **Parallel**: Use thread pools for independent operations

**Benchmarking**:
```bash
zig build benchmark
# Runs performance tests and compares to baseline
#
# organize:  1,245 files/sec (baseline: 1,180) ✓ +5.5%
# analyze:   1,123 files/sec (baseline: 1,050) ✓ +7.0%
# dedupe:      487 files/sec (baseline:   520) ✗ -6.3%
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All commands meet or exceed performance targets
- No performance regressions vs. v0.2.0
- Memory usage is reasonable (<100MB for typical operations)
- Benchmarks run in CI on each commit
- Performance characteristics documented

**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 hours

**Dependencies**: Phases 1-3 complete

**Labels**: performance, optimization, testing
